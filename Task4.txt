In HTML, both tags and elements play crucial roles in structuring and defining the content of a webpage. They are fundamental components of HTML markup. Let's briefly explain both terms with examples:


In HTML, both tags and elements play crucial roles in structuring and defining the content of a webpage. They are fundamental components of HTML markup. Let's briefly explain both terms with examples:

HTML Tags:

Tags are the building blocks of HTML documents.
They are used to define the structure and formatting of content on a webpage.
Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
Opening tags begin with < and end with >, while closing tags are similar but include a forward slash (/) before the tag name.
Tags provide instructions to web browsers on how to render content
example:
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>


HTML Elements:

An element is a combination of an opening tag, its content, and a closing tag (if applicable).
Elements represent the actual content that appears on the webpage.
Elements consist of the tag pair and any content between them.
Elements can be nested inside other elements to create complex structures.

example:
<p>This is a <strong>strong</strong> element inside a paragraph.</p>
